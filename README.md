# Pond Demo

Made in Pixi.js. Uses webpack to load everything. Thanks to
[mjapcks](https://gist.github.com/mjackson/ecd3914ebee934f4daf4) for the
figuring out how to load Pixi with webpack. (What a nightmare).

I found an older pixi [version of the fish/pond
demo](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/get-started-pixijs-81412778) and
decided to convert it to pixi 3.x to learn Pixi.js.
