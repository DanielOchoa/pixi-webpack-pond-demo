# Pond Demo

Made in Pixi.js. Uses webpack to load everything. Thanks to
[mjackson](https://gist.github.com/mjackson/ecd3914ebee934f4daf4) for figuring out
how to load Pixi with webpack. Based on an older Pixi [version of the fish/pond
demo](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/get-started-pixijs-81412778).

See this demo [here](http://danielochoa.github.io/pixi-webpack-pond-demo/).
